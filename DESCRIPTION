Description: Implements Visible Neural Networks (VNNs) whose architecture is
    constrained by prior biological knowledge such as gene-pathway mappings
    from KEGG, Gene Ontology, or MSigDB. Network connectivity mirrors known
    biology, so each hidden node corresponds to an interpretable biological
    concept (pathway, gene ontology term, or biological system). Heavy
    computation is delegated to a Julia backend (Lux.jl) via JuliaConnectoR,
    while the R frontend provides Bioconductor-native data handling with
    SummarizedExperiment objects and publication-ready interpretability
    visualizations. The key output is per-pathway importance scores that
    reveal which biological processes drive model predictions.
